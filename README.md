Rastapopoulos
=============

Rastapopoulos is a React-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing solar PV install information. It provides a dynamic table interface using Mantine React Table and integrates with the Snowy API for data management.

Project Overview
----------------

Rastapopoulos showcases a modular and scalable structure, utilizing various libraries for UI components, state management, and testing. The application allows users to view, create, update, and delete solar PV install information through an intuitive table interface.

-   **`types/`**: Contains TypeScript type definitions for the application's data models.
  -   **`elevation.ts`**: Defines the Elevation interface.
-   **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions and modules.
  -   **`api.ts`**: Defines the API request function and API service functions for interacting with the Snowy API.
-   **`theme.ts`**: Defines the Mantine theme configuration for the application.
-   **`next.config.mjs`**: Configuration file for Next.js.
-   **`postcss.config.cjs`**: Configuration file for PostCSS.

-   **`jest.config.cjs`** and **`jest.setup.cjs`**: Configuration files for Jest testing framework.

Application Flow
----------------

1.  The user navigates to the Elevations page (`app/elevations/page.tsx`).
2.  The `ElevationTableWrapper` component (`app/elevations/ElevationTableWrapper.tsx`) fetches the elevations data from the Snowy API using the `useQuery` hook from React Query.
3.  The `ElevationTable` component (`components/ElevationTable/ElevationTable.tsx`) renders the table with the fetched elevations data.
4.  The user can perform CRUD operations on the elevations:
  -   Create: The user can click the "Create New Elevation" button to open a modal and fill in the details for a new elevation. The `createMutation` from `ElevationTableWrapper` sends a POST request to the Snowy API to create the new elevation.
  -   Read: The user can view the elevations in the table and click on a row to see more details in the `ElevationDetails` component (`components/ElevationDetails/ElevationDetails.tsx`).
  -   Update: The user can click the edit icon on a row to open a modal and update the elevation details. The `updateMutation` from `ElevationTableWrapper` sends a PUT request to the Snowy API to update the elevation.
  -   Delete: The user can click the delete icon on a row to delete an elevation. The `deleteMutation` from `ElevationTableWrapper` sends a DELETE request to the Snowy API to delete the elevation.
5.  The `useElevations` hook (`hooks/useElevations.ts`) provides the necessary data fetching and mutation functions for managing elevations data using React Query.
6.  The `elevationsService` (`services/elevationsService.ts`) acts as an intermediary between the application and the Snowy API, providing functions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting elevations.
7.  The `api` utility module (`utils/api.ts`) handles the API requests and error handling, making use of the Mantine notifications system to display error messages.
